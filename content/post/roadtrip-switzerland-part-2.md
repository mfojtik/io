After arriving in Kandersteg, we settled into our rented apartment at the [Victoria Alpine Hotel](https://www.hotel-victoria.ch/) — a spot we’d stayed at on a previous visit and were more than happy to return to. Just like last time, everything was clean, cozy, and thoughtfully arranged. One of the biggest perks is how dog-friendly it is. The apartment has a door window that opens directly onto a grassy meadow, which meant we could step right outside for quick walks or let our dog stretch out in the sun — no stairs, no fuss.

Another huge bonus is the underground garage parking, which came in especially handy during the surprise snowfall. No scraping windshields or digging out the car — just hop in and go. The location itself is also ideal: close enough to the village center to walk for groceries. For what it offers, it’s surprisingly affordable, especially in a country where accommodation prices can easily skyrocket. It’s one of those places that makes you feel at home the moment you arrive — simple, practical, and surrounded by stunning views in every direction.

## Kandersteg - Base Camp
As a place to stay, Kandersteg provides the perfect starting point for many trips I’ll be writing about next — including Interlaken, Grindelwald (Eiger), Lauterbrunnen, and Spiez. What makes Kandersteg truly special, though, is how different it feels from the more touristy spots like Interlaken or Grindelwald. You won’t find shops pushing kitschy T-shirts or generic fridge magnets here. Instead, Kandersteg has held onto its authenticity, with a strong sense of local life still present. The town is dotted with cattle farms, cozy grocery stores, and even a charming little shop selling delicious local cheese.

It’s also an ideal spot if you’re traveling with a dog — there are countless trails and paths perfect for quiet morning or evening walks, often without encountering another soul. I imagine the town gets busier during the high season (June/July), but during our stay in April and May, it was absolute bliss. Just be prepared for the weather — it can shift fast and dramatically.

When we arrived, the weather was pure spring magic: lush greenery, sunny skies, and flowers blooming everywhere. But in true alpine fashion, everything changed overnight. We woke up to 60 cm of fresh snow — a stunning, snowy surprise. Thankfully, we came prepared, and with the temperatures staying mild, the snow added a fairytale touch to our stay. In fact, it stuck around almost until the very day we left, giving our spring getaway a beautiful, unexpected winter twist.

There are few places/hikes you can go to from Kandersteg by foot:

* [Oeschinen Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oeschinen_Lake) is the crown jewel of the region — and yes, its fame has skyrocketed thanks to Instagram and social media. But don’t let that fool you into thinking it’s overhyped. On the contrary, this lake is absolutely stunning and a must-see if you’re living in or visiting the area. Getting there does require a bit of effort: a steep 1.5-hour hike, so sturdy hiking shoes (preferably with Vibram soles) are a must. Once you reach the top, you’re rewarded not just with the jaw-dropping alpine scenery, but also with a cozy lakeside restaurant and restrooms — the perfect place to relax and soak in the views. Be prepared, though: on sunny days, the area draws a big crowd, with tourists from all over, especially Spain and Asia, and plenty of influencers posing lakeside (even where swimming is forbidden). Pro tip: take the time to hike around the lake and you’ll find a beautiful hidden waterfall. If the sun’s out, it’s the perfect spot for a quick, refreshing dip — just don’t forget your towel AND sun-cream!

* [Oeschiwald](https://mapy.com/en/zakladni?q=Oeschinen&source=osm&id=1066802680&ds=2&x=7.6790323&y=46.4955550&z=16) is a serene and enchanting forest that quickly became our favorite spot — and our dog’s too! Tucked away from the more crowded trails, this peaceful haven is part of a “vital park,” complete with outdoor gym equipment scattered along the paths for a refreshing workout in nature. What makes Oeschiwald truly special is its tranquil atmosphere; the dense trees and gentle sounds of the forest create an almost meditative calm. You’ll find a towering waterfall you can hike up to, several charming wooden bridges, and even a hidden forest lake where your dog can enjoy a refreshing dip. It’s the perfect escape into nature, just a short walk from the busier sights.

* [Almenbachfälle](https://mapy.com/en/zakladni?q=Oeschinen&source=osm&id=128793277&ds=2&x=7.6684751&y=46.4906654&z=16) is arguably the most scenic waterfall in the Kandersteg valley — and it’s hard to miss, as you can spot it from just about anywhere in town. Reaching it is surprisingly easy: a pleasant walk through Kandersteg, past a peaceful cow farm and even a Buddhist temple, leads you right to its base. The best part? You can get as close as you dare, feeling the raw power of the cascading water up close. Just be sure to wear waterproof clothing — the spray is no joke!

These are the main hikes/attactions, but there is much more. You can visit the swamps in Filfalle, take a short hike to international scouting center or take quick hike to Höh that provides awesome photo point... 

## Spiez - Gardens and Wine

We stumbled upon this charming city by chance, stopping in for groceries and to give our dog a quick walk — and it turned out to be one of the best decisions of our trip. The place feels almost otherworldly. From the beautifully manicured lawn surrounding the old church to the vibrant gardens filled with tulips and other alpine flowers, every corner seems like a scene from a postcard. A short walk leads you through historic vineyards, opening up to breathtaking views of Lake Thun and the picturesque town of Spiez. The real magic, though, lies in wandering past the traditional houses, each boasting stunning flower gardens that feel like secret paradises. If you’re anywhere near this city, do yourself a favor and make a stop — it’s absolutely worth it.
