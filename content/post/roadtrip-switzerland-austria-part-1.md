We live busy lifes and sometimes we need to turn off a little. In case with me, turning off means packing my shit and escaping to beautiful places where I can hike with my girlfriend and dog. There is no shortage of beautiful places in Slovakia where I live, but there is not much adventure in travelling to places where you live.
So we decided that this year, we will repeat our roadtrip to Switzerland. If you like hiking, beautiful landscapes and endless nature, you can't go wrong there.

## Preparations

Our final destination is Kandersteg. A small village/town southern of Interlaken. We start from Mikulov, Czech republic and from there it is almost 11 hours of car driving. So obviously, you need to cut this trip to half and find a place to sleep after 6h of staring on highway. You might guess that Switzerland is not the cheapest county in Europe so it is a good idea to get some supplies beforehand, just to avoid overspending on stupid things, like basic food or water. As for the dog, all you really need is EU pet pass with up-to-date vaccination. Not that somebody will check this, but in case you get into trouble, you might need it.
Another thing you should prepare yourself before coming to Switzerland is the fact EU roaming simply does not work here. This is super important if you are used to cross EU countries regularely and never need to think about your cell phone. In Switzerland, you will pay ridiculous amount of money when somebody call you and you want to call back to another EU country. So get yourself an e-sim with unlimited data - it will be handy on hikes/trips.
