We live busy lives, and sometimes, we just need to unplug. For me, that means packing my stuff and escaping to beautiful places where I can hike with my girlfriend and our dog. While Slovakia—where I live—has no shortage of stunning spots, there’s not much sense of adventure in exploring your own backyard.

That’s why we’ve decided to repeat our road trip to Switzerland this year. If you love hiking, breathtaking landscapes, and endless nature, you really can’t go wrong there.


## Preparations

Our final destination is [Kandersteg](https://adelboden-lenk-kandersteg.ch/orte/kandersteg)-a small village just south of Interlaken. We start our journey from Mikulov in the Czech Republic, and the drive takes nearly 11 hours. Naturally, you’ll want to break it up. After six hours of staring at the highway, finding a cozy spot to spend the night is a must.

As you might guess, Switzerland isn’t exactly the most budget-friendly country in Europe. So it's a smart move to stock up on essentials—think basic groceries and water—before crossing the border. It'll save you from spending a small fortune on everyday items.

Traveling with a dog? All you need is an [EU pet passport](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/carry/pets-and-other-animals/index_en.htm) with up-to-date vaccinations. Chances are, no one will check it—but if something goes wrong, you'll be glad you have it.

One more thing to prep for: EU roaming doesn't apply in Switzerland. This is huge if you’re used to hopping across EU countries without giving your phone bill a second thought. In Switzerland, even receiving a call can cost you a ridiculous amount, and calling back to another EU country is no better. Do yourself a favor and get an [eSIM](http://rwrd.io/1q295kr) with unlimited data—it’ll be a lifesaver during hikes and day trips.


## Seefeld in Tirol

After just six hours on the road—mostly a long stretch of the typically uneventful Austrian highway—we finally reached our first stop: [Seefeld](https://www.gemeinde-seefeld.eu/). 

Seefeld is just a few kilometers from Innsbruck, and we figured it would be the perfect place to break up the journey. We chose to stay at [Krumers](https://www.krumers.com/) hotel—because after six hours in the car, nothing beats a good spa and sauna session to soothe those stiff, swollen muscles.

While the hotel’s location was a slight letdown—it’s a bit far from the town center—our dog didn’t seem to mind the extra walk. And honestly, the walk turned out to be totally worth it. We stumbled upon [Wildsee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8jLrVvYsbcDppjo6), a serene lake surrounded by picturesque views. It was the perfect evening stroll and just tiring enough to get our dog to knock out early—giving us a guilt-free evening to enjoy the spa.

As a bonus, we were able to fully charge our hybrid car for free.

## Lucerne

We loaded ourselves back into the car and hit the road again. This stretch was a completely different experience compared to the uneventful Austrian highways. Instead of taking the standard route through Zurich, we crossed into [Liechtenstein](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GDzUzkQTpzk7xczx7) via [Feldkirch](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9whNHNKrusccBZ3E6)—and it was absolutely worth it. The drive takes you through perfectly manicured gardens and elegant homes, each looking like they’ve been plucked from a postcard.

The border crossing into Switzerland is so seamless, you might miss it if you blink. No police checks, no passport control—just a smooth transition into one of the most scenic drives you can imagine.

Swiss highways are in a league of their own. The landscapes shift dramatically—from towering snow-covered mountains to vast, sparkling lakes. Every time you exit one of the endless tunnels, it’s like entering a new world. We intentionally avoided Bern and chose a route through [Lucerne](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rRUfChS1EcDuKyhy6), which gave us even more scenic variety.

Once we reached Lucerne, we had a bit of a struggle finding a parking garage. There are plenty, but you need to drive slowly and stay alert—navigating the city isn’t exactly stress-free. But once we parked and let our dog out, she was thrilled to be free again and ready to explore.

Lucerne has a few must-sees. The old town is charming, though a bit touristy with its shops and souvenir stands. But the lakeside views and iconic wooden bridges—especially the Chapel Bridge—are real highlights and steeped in history. The area is also very dog-friendly, which would’ve been great... if our anti-social, wannabe-assassin border collie hadn’t been on high alert the entire time. But as always, we managed.
